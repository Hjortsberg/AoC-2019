# AoC-2019
Advent of Code 2019

Hello, I'm trying to get better at Golang and will do the tasks in Advent of Code.
I will try to do as many of these that I have time for.

I'm sure that you can spot some weird noob syntax and I will be grateful for any constructive comments that can make my code more idiomatic.

Happy holidays!
